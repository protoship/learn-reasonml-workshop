  Sometimes rather than redefining the record you would like to have a field or
  a set of fields that you can modify on the fly.

  In Reason if you want to have a field in a record that can be updated in place,
  you must use some additional syntax. The mutable keyword makes the field
  modifiable.

  Then you can update those fields in place with the = operator.
