/*
  We can easily write a function that adds 1 to any number.
  Recall that the infix operator (+) will add two integers.
 */
let add1 = x => x + 1;

/*
  Let's write a function that squares its argument (multiplies it by itself)
 */
let square = x => x * x;

/*
  Functions are first class in Reason. This means that you can take
  a function and pass it around as an argument to other functions.

  Let's write a function named twice: it will take a function and apply
  that function to itself two times.

  For example, if we wanted to make an "add2" function, we could do it
  by writing:
  let add2 = twice(add1)
 */
let twice = (f, x) => f(x) |> f;

/* Now that we have twice, write add2 and raiseToTheFourth */
let add2 = x => twice(add1, x);

let raiseToTheFourth = x => twice(square, x); /* Hint: use square */
