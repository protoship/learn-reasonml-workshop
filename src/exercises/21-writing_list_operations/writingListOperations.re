/*
  As we've seen, in Reason, instead of for loops we use "higher order functions"
  to itereate over collections like lists. Higher order functions, in other
  words, are functions that take other functions as input. Let's take a deeper
  look at the [List.fold_left] function, which has the signature:

  let fold_left: (('a, 'b) => 'a, 'a, list('b)) => 'a

  'a is the type of the accumulator, and 'b is the type of the values in the
  input list.

  The 1st argument is a function for updating the accumulator. The 2nd
  argument is the initial accumulator value. The final argument is the list
  to process.

  List.fold_left walks over the list from left to right, updating the
  accumulator at each step and returning the final value of the accumulator
  when it's done.

  Let's revisit the sumOfMyInts example we've seen before. In this case, types
  'a and 'b are both equal to int.
 */
let ints = [1, 2, 3];

let sumOfMyInts = List.fold_left((total, myInt) => total + myInt, 0, ints);

let () = assert (6 == sumOfMyInts);

/* Now let's use List.fold_left to write some other useful List functions. */
module MyList: {
  /*
    map(f, list) takes a function [f] from ('a => 'b) and a list('a) and
    returns a list('b) (e.g. [f] applied to each element)
   */
  let map: ('a => 'b, list('a)) => list('b);
  /*
    iter(f, list) calls [f] on each element in [list]. Since [f] returns
    [unit], there is nothing to return
   */

    consisting of all elements [f] returned [true] for

let () = assert (List.hd([1, 2, 3]) == 1);

/*
  Similarly, List.tl returns all but the first element of the list. It also raises
  an exception if called on an empty list. The signature is:

  let tl: list('a) => list('a);

  List.rev returns the reverse of the input list.

/*
  List.sort returns a sorted list in increasing order according to the specified
